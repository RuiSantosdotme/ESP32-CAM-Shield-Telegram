# ESP32-CAM with Telegram: Take Photos, Control Outputs, Request Sensor Readings and Motion Notifications

In this project we'll create a PCB shield for the ESP32-CAM AI-Thinker board with a PIR motion sensor, a BME280 temperature, humidity and pressure sensor and some additional exposed pins. We'll create a Telegram bot for the ESP32-CAM that allows you to control your board from anywhere to request a photo, sensor readings or control the flash. Additionally, you'll receive a notification with a new photo whenever motion is detected.
